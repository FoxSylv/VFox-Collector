# VFox Bot

Now introducing, the best way to find virtual foxes on Discord! Fully humane, and fully fun.
Your progress stays between servers. So you can hunt in private to impress your friends!

Sacrifice foxes at the shrine for short-term buffs, or sell them to purchase equipment for permanent boosts.
In addition, there are over 40 different single-use items which can combo with everything else for even more options!

Seriously, there is so much content in this bot. Go check it out!
