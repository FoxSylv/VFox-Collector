In this game, the goal is to collect as many foxes as possible. The twist is that the more foxes you have, the harder they are to find!
Luckily, you can forfeit foxes at the \`shrine\` to gain upgrades! Or you can \`sell\` them for coins to use at the \`shop\` for better equipment
Either way, the choice is yours! Good luck hunting!\n
(You can see this tutorial again plus any others you have seen in the \`tutorials\` screen)`},
    coins: {title: "Coins", tutorial: `Congratulations! You just got 100 foxes at once!
You can now \`sell\` them to get coins\n
Coins are used in the \`shop\` to acquire better fox-finding gear
You can equip and unequip gear in its shop screen after you have it acquired
You can view everything that you are currently using in the \`equips\` screen`},
    items: {title: "Items", tutorial: `Congratulations! You just got your first item\n
\`items\` give small boosts to your fox-finding capabilties
Some give temporary effects that can last until you next find an item or beyond!\n
(You can view all active effects in your \`equips\` screen)`},
    rarefox: {title: "Rare Foxes", tutorial: `Congratulations! You just got your first rare fox\n
When \`sell\`ing, rare foxes are valued higher than normal foxes
Rare foxes aren't worth more at the \`shrine\`, however
You can view the breakdown of your foxes in your \`pen\``}
